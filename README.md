# Human Pose Estimation and Recognition
Human pose estimation and recognition is a kind of vital vision tasks, which are boosted by both deep learning and 2.5D/3D sensors recently. This repo would give a curated list of papers and related projects about this field.

## Contents
Inspired by [Human Pose Estimation from RGB Camera](https://github.com/horefice/Human-Pose-Estimation-from-RGB), all methods are labelled by the following icons and characteristics:

- Sensors:
    - :camera: Single-view
    - :camera::camera: Multiple-view
    - :video_camera: Depth sensor
- Number of people
    - :runner: Single-person
    - :couple: Multiple-person
- Spatial dimensions:
    - [2D models](#2d_models)
    - [3D models](#3d_models)
